# TRANSFORMER-BASED-ONLINE-DETECTION-OF-AI-GENERATED-IMAGES
⚠️ **Important Usage Notice**  
This repository contains research code for reference purposes only. Due to the circumstances described below, please note:

1. **Limited Validation**  
   - The provided code has undergone basic functionality tests to ensure it can run without errors  
   - The current version produces **sample outputs** but does not include full training/evaluation results  
   - Model weights are not included due to size constraints (original >1.2GB)

2. **Reproducibility Statement**  
   - The exact experimental results in the paper were obtained using specialized hardware (NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti 16GB)  
   - Some training details (e.g., hyperparameter tuning logs) were lost during development  
   - For **fully reproducible results**, please contact: [skw0852@autuni.ac.nz]  

3. **Recommended Use Cases**  
   - Study the model architecture implementation (AAM + Swin Transformer)  
   - Adapt components for your own research  
   - Verify core algorithm designs described in the paper
